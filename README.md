# *UTILE-Gen* - Synthetic image generator to expand annotated datasets in the realm of nanoscience

## Description
This project focus on the generation of synthetic images based on domain randomization to generate endless materials science similar datasets.
This repository contains the Python implementation of the UTILE-Gen software for the domain randomization guided creation of synthetic dataset with the corresponding instance segmentation mask

## Installation
In order to run the actual version of the code, the following steps need to be done:
- Clone the repository
- Create a new environment using Anaconda using Python 3.8 or superior
- Pip install the jupyter notebook library
    pip install notebook
- From your Anaconda console open jupyter notebook (just tip "jupyter notebook" and a window will pop up)
- Open the DatasetGenerator.ipynb file from the jupyter notebook directory

## Dependencies
The following libraries are needed to run the program:
  pip install opencv-python
  pip install --upgrade Pillow
  pip install pyimagej
  pip install scipy

#### Notes
- Depending on your environment additional libraries could be required.
